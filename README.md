TaskerRsyncSL4A
===============

Python implementation of the rsync protocol.
Automated Events are triggered by tasker and the script is run through SL4A.

This allowed me to sync large amount of data in an incremental fashion.
This was part of my learning of python programming.

The script still runs by, but there are better ways to do the same thing nowadays :)
